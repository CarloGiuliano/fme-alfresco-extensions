This Extension was made for an Alfresco customer of [http://www.fme.de fme AG]

==Features==
===Automatic ID generation===
automatic generation of an ID for each item of a datalist. These IDs are generated using a separate ID sequence on each datalist.

===Read-only/view dialog===
Double clicking an item displays a view-mode form using Alfresco FormService.

===Auto versioning===
Aspect cm:versionable with auto-version on property changes is applied to each datalist item. A custom policy triggers versioning if an association was modified  - e.g. dl:assignee.

To display the version history of a datalist item a new FormService control was implemented. The show version link will open the selected version in another view-mode dialog.

===Comments thread===

Alfresco only supports a simple comment field, but you often like to have a discussion thread as you have in the document library. Hence we added support of fm:discussable aspect to datalist items including the necessary form controls & FormFilters.

===Ellipsis for long text===
Per default the whole text of a property is displayed in the datagrid. If you’ve a longer text – e.g. in cm:description – your datagrid layout will be suboptimal.

Thus, we added an ellipsis feature for text longer than 40 chars. The whole text will be displayed as tooltip on mouse over.

===Upload & Attach===

To support the direct attachment of a file to a datalist item that isn’t already stored in the repo an upload&attach action was added to cm:attachment-control.

===XLS Export===
Nick Burch had already developed a basic XLS-export WebScript. We resused that one & added support for fm:discussable comment threads.

XLS-Export button is displayed in the datalist toolbar.

===Filters===
We added form based filters for each type of datalists to allow an user-friendly filtering of datalist items. These filters are also based on Alfresco's FormService and browser history & URL addressability are suppported.
